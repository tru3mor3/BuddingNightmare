Budding Nightmare - Classic DOOM-styled Shooter
WORK IN PROGRESS
Modified code from https://www.youtube.com/@CoderSpaceChannel

To Do:
- Finish replacing art assets
- Change sounds and music
- Add timer and scoring system
- Clean up code

This was one of the first programming tutorials I started when I was
first learning Python. Knowing what I know now, I recognize some parts
could be written a little cleaner. Someday this README will not be so
basic. Thanks for stopping by!
